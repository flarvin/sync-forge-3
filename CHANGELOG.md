## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Fluent sync API with chunked reconciliation pipeline.
- DBAL bridge components for existing-row loading and platform detection.
- PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, and fallback batch executors.
- Composite key support and scalar diff engine with partial updates.
- Safety guard for `deleteMissing(true)` with empty input source.
- `continueOnError` mode with aggregated sync errors in `SyncResult`.
- Symfony bundle/extension wiring for autowiring integration.
- Quality tooling:
  - PHPStan (strict/deprecation/phpunit rules)
  - PHP-CS-Fixer
  - Unit and integration tests
  - GitHub Actions CI for SQLite + PostgreSQL + MySQL

### Changed
- `FallbackBatchExecutor` behavior is now explicit dry-run-only in write mode.
- `SyncResult` now exposes `errors` and a non-trivial `isSuccess()`.

- Date comparison normalization now handles common DB datetime string formats.

### Fixed
- DBAL 4 connection setup in integration tests (`driver` required).
- Identifier quoting in DBAL existing-row lookup paths.
- Deprecated/unsafe SQL identifier quoting patterns in executor paths.
